        <blockquote>
        <p>There are some other modular solutions for CSS (such as OOCSS, AMCSS, SMACSS, SUITCSS). What are the reasons to choose BEM?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>BEM provides solutions for all the frontend technologies: CSS, JavaScript, templating; and also for building process of your web application. The methodology is applicable anywhere. However, to apply this in JavaScript and templating you would need special frameworks whereas in CSS you may just follow the methodological recommendations. The CSS part of BEM is the easiest to take into your development process. This is why many use only it. On the other hand, if lately you would found your project fully BEMed (in CSS) and yourself happy for its grown maintenance, you probably would take next step in modularizing your web application. BEM CSS will be easier to coordinate with modular JavaScript and blocks-based project file structure.</p>
        <p>If speaking about CSS modular solutions only, the key feature of BEM is block's independence. Following the CSS recommendations enables to put a block into any place on a page and be sure that is won't be affected by its surroundings. Also, if you would lately need to nest another block into the current one, their full compatibility is guaranteed. In other words, when maintaining your web application you would be able to move blocks across the page, add others and combine them.</p>
        <p>BEM CSS unambiguously defines which CSS belongs to a piece of interface and so using it gives answers to questions "Can I remove this piece of code?" and "What happens and which interface parts will be affected if I change this piece of code?".</p>
